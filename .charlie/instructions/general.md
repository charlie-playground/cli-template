# General Guidelines

- Write elegant, concise, and readable code
- Use descriptive variable, function, and class names that clearly indicate purpose and functionality
- Follow the existing project structure and patterns when adding new features or making changes
- Maintain consistent error handling approaches throughout the codebase
- Use ES modules syntax for imports and exports (the project uses `type: "module"`)
- Keep functions focused on a single responsibility
- Avoid deeply nested code structures when possible
- Document any complex logic with clear comments
- Prefer clarity over brevity when the two are in conflict
